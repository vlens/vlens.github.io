            <p>the botanic gardens are as beautiful as they were before <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#bad">everything went bad<sup>1</sup></a>, if you ask me. the plants still bloom, the birds still sing, and the feral cats still hunt the birds. it is beautiful-but-soft in the morning light, and beautiful-yet-menacing when the sun sets and everything turns blue and purple. i used to be fit enough to hike up here on my lunch break. i didn't, of course. i took the cable car, like other people who didn't like to bother with hiking. now, many years later, the cable car no longer runs, and the walk takes me an hour and a half.</p>

            <div id="bad" class="collapse"><p><sup>1</sup> I suppose not *everything* went bad. Some of the people are still good. Life still flourishes, in the most unexpected places. But the apocalypse was not a happy event, and many of us are still suffering. Most people who died were laid to rest in the first year, when it was blisteringly hot and things would not grow. Now we have reached a sort of uneasy equilibrium, where we are able to live our lives, healthy but abnormal. The infrastructure of the world has been damaged, and we cannot come back from that easily. We can only move forward, and we all have to do it together.</p></div>
            
            <p>the roses used to be well-maintained, all in neat bushes, carefully trimmed back. now they live in a wild tangle that sprawls over the paths. familiar plants now look strange. things are growing where they shouldn't, in ways they shouldn't, out in the world and here <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#inside">inside of me<sup>2</sup></a>. i wake up in the night, soaked with sweat, and it takes a long time to get back to sleep. i am not the only one who is changing, but there aren't that many of us and sometimes i am afraid. to get to the top of the gardens i have to step around thorns, over roots that seem to move, avoiding new growth i cannot understand. it would be a difficult walk even if everything was working properly.</p>
            
            <div id="inside" class="collapse"><p><sup>2</sup> My body used to be well-maintained, all in neat categories, carefully trimmed back. Now I live in a wild tangle that sprawls over the boundaries. Familiar parts now look strange. Eyes are growing where they shouldn't, in ways they shouldn't. When they are on my legs and arms, I can hide them well enough. On the trunk is slightly worse. But the first one has grown above my collar bone now, and when I look down at it, I look back at myself. I think more are coming - they begin as tell-tale lumps of varying sizes, milky under the skin, and the skin gets thinner and thinner until they erupt out. It doesn't hurt as much as you might think, but it is tender and itchy.</p></div>
            
            <p>i do not come here for the beauty. i come here because the edible gardens, near the top of the hill, still grow food, and my garden back at home has been ravaged by <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#wild">wild animals<sup>3</sup></a>. i need to eat, and now it is not just me. i wheel a shopping cart ahead of me, both to help carry things and to give me the support i need. while i pick carrots from the earth i am thinking of a bright-eyed young woman named hannah. hannah is one of the optimistic few trying to help rebuild. she told me that, given enough time, they can get solar panels working. i am thinking of the cable car, and of the abandoned elevator that would have brought me to the edible gardens in a fifth of the time. for now, i have to make the walk myself. something is wrong with the snow peas, and they have grown sharp needles all over them, making them not worth picking. it's an interesting adaptation, more useful than mine.</p>
            
            <div id="wild" class="collapse"><p><sup>3</sup> At least, I assume they were animals. The marks where things have been broken and dug up did not look human, but in this day and age, that doesn't necessarily mean anything. I live close to the dogwoods, where wild packs hunt and howl, and I am hoping it was them. I can deal with dogs, no matter how strange they are now. It's the unknown, other option that worries me.</p></div>
            
            <p>i am thinking about hannah, and marvelling at the ability of young people to be happy in the face of the apocalypse. i am thinking of <a onclick="swaplove" id="thinking" href="">her smile</a>.</p>
